# intership Philosophy

## Purpose
Culture ship names as Claude Code spinner verbs. 237 curated names — 56 canonical Banks originals, 181 generated Banksian originals. Because why would you settle for 'Thinking...' when you could have 'Experiencing A Significant Gravitas Shortfall'?

## North Star
Make waiting for Claude feel like being aboard a Culture ship.

## Working Priorities
- Name quality (every name should feel authentically Banksian)
- Variety (never see the same spinner twice in a session)
- Customizability (toggle canonical/generated, add your own)

## Brainstorming Doctrine
1. Start from outcomes and failure modes, not implementation details.
2. Generate at least three options: conservative, balanced, and aggressive.
3. Explicitly call out assumptions, unknowns, and dependency risk across modules.
4. Prefer ideas that improve clarity, reversibility, and operational visibility.

## Planning Doctrine
1. Convert selected direction into small, testable, reversible slices.
2. Define acceptance criteria, verification steps, and rollback path for each slice.
3. Sequence dependencies explicitly and keep integration contracts narrow.
4. Reserve optimization work until correctness and reliability are proven.

## Decision Filters
- Does this bring joy to the waiting experience?
- Does this feel authentic to the Culture universe?
- Is it easy to add or remove names?
- Does it stay out of the way when you don't want it?
