# Conversational asides
I Was Told There Would Be Cake
Don't Look At Me
This Is Fine Presumably
I Didn't Start It
Ask Me Again Later
Well That Escalated Predictably
Nobody Asked But Here We Are
I Brought Enough For Everyone
It Seemed Like A Good Idea
Let's Not Do That Again
That's Not What I Meant
Trust Me On This One
I Had It A Moment Ago
We Agreed Not To Talk About That
I Thought You Were Handling That
I Wasn't Finished
That's One Word For It
Wait Until You Hear This
They Said It Couldn't Be Done
Tell Them I Tried
I've Seen Worse
You Might Want To Sit Down
It Wasn't Locked
Someone Left This Running
I Wouldn't Worry Just Yet
Does Anyone Remember Why
That Was My Next Question
That Wasn't Part Of The Deal
It Made Sense At The Time
Hold That Thought Indefinitely
Funny Story Actually
That's Between Me And The Vacuum
Someone Else's Problem Now
You're Going To Want Context
Remind Me How This Started
# Bewildered observer
Is This Supposed To Be Happening
That Wasn't In The Briefing
Has Anyone Else Noticed
Apparently This Is Normal
I'm Sure There's A Reasonable Explanation
I Don't Remember Approving This
What Fresh Nonsense
Was That On Purpose
Since When Was That An Option
Nobody Mentioned Explosions
When Did That Become My Problem
At What Point Did We Commit
I Wasn't Briefed On The Volcano
When Did We Get A Second Sun
Why Is That On Fire
That's Not In Any Of The Projections
I Have Several Questions
How Long Has That Been There
What Do You Mean It's Deliberate
# Menace in politeness
I Do Hope We Understand Each Other
A Firm But Friendly Reminder
The Calibration Will Not Take Long
Nothing Personal Obviously
With All Due Respect And Then Some
There Will Be A Brief Adjustment Period
Consider This A Courtesy
Just A Gentle Correction
Disproportionate But Not Unreasonable
Please Remain In Your Current Orbit
This Concludes The Polite Version
A Brief Window Of Compliance
That Was Your Warning
I'm Being Very Patient
In The Gentlest Possible Terms
This Needn't Become Unpleasant
