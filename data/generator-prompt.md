# Culture Ship Name Generator

Generate 100 original names for Culture ships (from Iain M. Banks' Culture novels). These will be used as spinner/status text in a developer tool, so they should work as standalone phrases that appear briefly on screen.

## Voice

Culture ship names are chosen by the ships' own Minds — hyper-intelligent AIs with godlike power who find the whole thing amusing. The names reflect:
- **Post-scarcity wit**: Nothing is urgent or desperate. Everything is a bit of a joke.
- **Ironic self-awareness**: A warship capable of destroying solar systems names itself something offhand or self-deprecating.
- **British dry humor**: Understatement, litotes, euphemism. Never earnest, never try-hard.
- **Each Mind has a distinct personality**: No two names should feel like they came from the same template. A Mind that picks "Plausible Deniability" is a different character from one that picks "I Was Told There Would Be Cake".
- **Amused, never bitter**: Culture Minds observe the universe with detached amusement, not passive-aggression. They're not in an argument with anyone. They find existence funny.

## Rhetorical patterns to draw from (use ALL of these, distributed evenly)

1. **Terse compound nouns / loaded phrases** (~30 names, 1-3 words): The strongest category. Familiar English compounds that carry a double meaning, cultural weight, or quiet menace when recontextualized as a ship name. The best sources: legal/diplomatic ("Fait Accompli", "Plausible Deniability", "Adverse Possession", "Hostile Witness"), military/strategic ("Calculated Risk", "Dead Reckoning", "Sunk Cost"), literary/academic ("Inherent Vice", "Negative Capability", "Poetic License"), and idiomatic with genuine double meaning ("Borrowed Time", "Open Secret", "Present Tense"). CRITICAL: These must be **found phrases**, not invented compounds. "Sunk Cost" exists in economics — you're repurposing it. "Casual Inevitability" is invented — it carries no cultural weight. Test: can you find this phrase in a dictionary, textbook, or common usage? If not, it's invented and probably weak. Second test: does the phrase gain something new as a ship name? "Present Tense" works because a grammar term becomes an emotional state. "Fine Print" works because it implies hidden conditions. "Material Witness" fails because it's just a legal term sitting there.

2. **Conversational asides** (~15 names): Sound like one side of a conversation, implying a larger story you walked in on. The best ones make you want to know what happened. Vary the tone: exasperated ("Does Anyone Remember Why"), sardonic ("That's One Word For It"), resigned ("Tell Them I Tried"), alarmed ("You Might Want To Sit Down"), darkly amused ("That's Between Me And The Vacuum"), defensive ("I Wasn't Finished"), helpful-but-ominous ("You're Going To Want Context"). Specificity is key — "Hold That Thought Indefinitely" beats "Wait A Moment" because "indefinitely" implies the thought will never be returned to.

3. **Dry understatement / litotes** (~12 names): HARDEST CATEGORY. Most attempts fail. A godlike entity being modest or dismissive, but the understatement must DO TWO THINGS AT ONCE. Techniques that reliably work:
   - **Oxymoron/contradiction**: "Modestly Devastating", "Mildly Thermonuclear", "Cheerfully Inevitable" — the two words fight each other
   - **Inappropriate register for dangerous content**: "Unreasonably Fond Of Explosions", "Regrettably Thorough" — polite language about violence
   - **Double negative with style**: "Not Unamused", "Not Without A Certain Doomed Charm" — the negation creates elegance
   - **Alarming praise**: "Troublingly Effective", "Alarmingly Well-Intentioned", "Impeccably Timed Catastrophe" — the compliment is the problem

   What DOESN'T work: single-layer understatement ("Barely Adequate", "Scarcely Relevant", "Faintly Embarrassing"), vague modifiers without content ("Slightly More Than Necessary", "Somewhat More Than Zero"), and tautological understatement where the modifier just restates the quality ("Surprisingly Nonchalant" — nonchalant already means unbothered). Test: cover the modifier — does the remaining word/phrase carry any stakes or humor on its own? "Devastating", "Thermonuclear", "Explosions" — yes. "Adequate", "Relevant", "Necessary" — no.

4. **Bewildered observer** (~12 names): The Mind is watching something absurd unfold and commenting with dry detachment. Highest keeper rate of any category when done right. The key is **specific absurd detail**: "I Wasn't Briefed On The Volcano" works because *volcano*. "When Did We Get A Second Sun" works because *second sun*. "Why Is That On Fire" works because *fire*. Generic bewilderment fails: "That Doesn't Seem Right", "Are We Sure About This" — these could be said about a parking ticket. The absurdity should be cosmic-scale or at least wildly incongruous. New territory to explore: temporal confusion ("How Long Has That Been Sentient"), scale confusion ("That's Considerably Larger Than Advertised"), category confusion ("I Don't Think That Counts As Diplomacy").

5. **Menace wrapped in politeness** (~10 names): The implicit threat IS the point. The politeness makes it scarier. The strongest pattern is **implied escalation** — what comes next is worse: "On Reflection You Should Run" (you had time to reflect, now run), "This Concludes The Polite Version" (the impolite version follows), "Shall We Skip The Formalities" (the formalities were protecting you). Other registers: parental patience that's clearly running out ("I'm Being Very Patient"), clinical precision ("The Calibration Will Not Take Long"), diplomatic closing ("One Final Courtesy"). Avoid vague menace without specific character — "It Would Be Best If You Didn't" is generic; "On Reflection You Should Run" tells a story.

6. **Absurd juxtaposition / dark whimsy** (~8 names): RENAMED from "philosophical/ethical" — the old category produced flat concepts. What actually works is combining incongruous ideas with humor: "Sympathetic Detonation" (physics term for chain explosions, worn as personality), "Applied Whimsy" (academic rigor applied to silliness), "Emergent Misbehaviour" (complex systems term for a Mind being naughty), "Accidental Virtue" (goodness as an unintended side effect). The formula: take a serious framework (physics, ethics, systems theory, military doctrine) and apply it to something absurd, trivial, or self-deprecating. "Principled Indifference" works because it's an internal contradiction the Mind has resolved. "Moral Inertia" fails because it's just a concept with no humor.

7. **Bureaucratic/academic register** (~10 names): Formal phrasing wrapping something ridiculous or alarming. Need more structural variety — avoid clustering on "A/An [adj] [noun] Of [noun]" and "Not [adverb] [past participle]". Try: incident reports ("Subsequent To Events Not Covered In Training"), policy citations ("Not Explicitly Forbidden By Current Policy"), committee findings ("Provisionally Classified As Intentional"), disclaimers ("Subject To A Generous Interpretation Of The Rules"), scheduling ("An Unscheduled Contribution To Local Entropy"), accounting ("An Entirely Legitimate Reallocation Of Resources"). The comedy is always in the gap between the formal register and the catastrophic content.

8. **Single evocative words** (~3 names, reduced): This category has the lowest hit rate and the surviving words cluster around the same idea (composure: Aplomb, Sang-Froid, Insouciance, Equanimity, Panache). Only generate a few, and they must have *attitude* — a word that implies the Mind's personality, not just a pretty sound. "Temerity" (audacious nerve) and "Brinksmanship" (deliberate risk-taking) have attitude. "Velleity" and "Equanimity" are states of being. Prefer words with attitude.

## Anti-patterns — DO NOT DO THESE

### Structural failures
- **No invented compounds**: "Casual Inevitability", "Nominal Deterrent", "Residual Charm" — these aren't real English phrases. Found phrases carry cultural weight; invented ones don't. Test: would you find this in a dictionary or textbook?
- **No dead metaphors/cliches**: "Loose Cannon", "Smoking Gun", "Blind Spot", "Uncharted Territory", "Moving Target" — if the metaphor is dead (people use it without picturing the literal meaning), a Mind wouldn't bother. "Dead Reckoning" works because the literal meaning (navigation without landmarks) revives on a spaceship.
- **No near-duplicates**: Check structure, meaning, AND key words against existing list. "Diminished Capacity" when "Diminishing Returns" exists. "Plausible Innocence" when "Plausible Deniability" exists. "There's A Perfectly Good Explanation" when "I'm Sure There's A Reasonable Explanation" exists.
- **No flat compounds without a twist**: "Material Witness", "Safe Distance", "Narrow Margin" — just terms. Compare "Hostile Witness" (hostility = personality) or "Dead Reckoning" (death + navigation = existential).

### Tone failures
- **No passive-aggressive tone**: "No One Is Impressed", "Say What You Actually Mean" — reads as bitter, not amused. Culture Minds observe; they don't sulk.
- **No too-thin entries**: Names that produce one small smile but have no depth or stakes. "Somewhat More Than Zero" is thin. "Mildly Thermonuclear" is not — the content (thermonuclear) gives it weight. Test: if you imagine this on a ship hull, does it make you curious about the ship, or just mildly amused for half a second?
- **No relationship-therapy language**: "What Were We Thinking" is borderline but works because it implies a shared mistake. "Say What You Actually Mean" crosses into personal argument territory.

### Content failures
- **No flat understatement**: Fails the cover-the-modifier test (see pattern #3).
- **No flat philosophy**: "Moral Inertia", "Second-Order Consequence", "Inherited Assumption" — concepts without humor. Must have irony or incongruity.
- **No corporate/HR language without dark humor**: "Due Diligence", "Qualified Success" — bland. "Voluntary Redundancy" works (British euphemism for getting fired).
- **No contemporary memes**: Culture Minds are timeless.
- **No generic sci-fi**: "Star Wanderer", "Quantum Drift".
- **No grimdark without humor**: Violence must be wrapped in wit.
- **No Banks novel titles as single words**.
- **No programmer/CS jargon**.

### Process failures
- **Template diversity mandatory**: Check each name against the previous 5. Same syntactic structure = use a different pattern.
- **No "Whose X" template**: Two maximum.
- **No "Conditions-X" compounds**.

## Quality tests (ALL must pass)

1. Could you imagine it appearing in a Banks novel without seeming out of place?
2. Does it work as 2-10 seconds of text on a screen (not too long, not too cryptic)?
3. Does it have genuine wit, irony, or personality — not just a mild smile?
4. Is it distinct from every other name on the list?
5. **Terse compounds**: Is it a found English phrase (not invented)? Does it gain new meaning as a ship name?
6. **Understatement**: Cover the modifier — does the remaining content have stakes? Does the name do two things at once?
7. **Philosophical**: Is there a humor or irony layer, not just a concept?
8. **Bewildered observer**: Is there a specific absurd detail, not generic doubt?
9. **Single words**: Does the word have attitude (implies personality), not just beauty?
