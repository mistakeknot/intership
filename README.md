# intership

Culture ship names as Claude Code spinner verbs.

Instead of "Thinking..." you get "Experiencing A Significant Gravitas Shortfall" or "Falling Outside The Normal Moral Constraints".

## Install

```bash
claude plugins install /path/to/intership
```

Ship names load automatically on session start.

## Customize

```
/intership:setup
```

Filter by book, add your own ships, or toggle between replace/append mode.

## Ships

Edit `data/ships.txt` directly: one name per line, `#` comments for organization. Changes apply next session.
